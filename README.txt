In this project, I mainly used jupyter notebook to explore DR & Cluring algorithms in 5 tasks. [HW3.ipynb]
The writeup contains all my exploration and analysis. [hyang412-analysis.pdf]
Finally, I collected essential codes in py file in case you want to reproduced the details in my write up. [code.py]
For running the code, there is no special requirements for the environment. Please check if you have installed following two packages to support the analysis.
1. sklearn
2. numpy
3. itertools
